Cycle Fitness is what has resulted from a 2 partner collaboration between NYU engineering students Mitch McAffee and Rahul Ramkumar started in the late '90s in order to build custom bicycles using University machining equipment to make getting around the city easier. Mitch and Rahul are still a part of Cycle Fitness today, along with 4 other bicycle and engineering enthusiasts.

We produce custom bicycles using a proprietary in house welding technique that we like to call Electric-Symbiosis and custom metal alloys utilising very high strength to weight ratio. 

As a customer we encourage you to check out the different types of bikes we produce [here](http://rahulramkumar.github.io/cyclefitness/bikes) and we can work together from there to create a bike that agrees with all your personal needs and your wallet.

We're open Monday-Friday from 9am to 6pm, Saturdays 8am to 4pm, and closed Sundays. Walk-ins welcomed. Come check us out!
