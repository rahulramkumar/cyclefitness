<h1>Road Bikes</h1> <br>

Road bikes are meant to be used on paved surfaces and are characterised by narrow tires that are around 100psi, derailleur gears, and lightweight frame. <br><br><br>

<h1>Mountain Bikes</h1> <br>

Mountain bikes are intended for off-road use where any type of terrain is possible. Rain or shine a mountain bike will get you from Point-A to Point-B and let you have a hell of a time getting there. These are characterised by soft suspensions, wider, thicker wheels with large amounts of grip, and lower ratio gearing for hill climbing. <br><br><br>

<h1>Track Bikes</h1> <br>

Track bikes are used on specially made tracks and are not intended to be used outdoors. If you need one you already know what they are. <br><br><br>

<h1>Cyclocross Bikes</h1> <br>

Cyclocross can be used a variety of places and are essentially road bikes with extra grip and a softer suspension. These probably won't handle mountain terrain but biking across Central Park will be a breeze. <br><br><br>

<h1>Folding Bikes</h1> <br>

Not much more to say here, it's a bike and it folds. Needing to take a long trip on MTA? This is the one for you.<br><br><br>

<h1>Electric-Assist Bikes</h1> <br>

Tired of pedaling? Live uphill from somewhere else? Then you'll love an electric assist bike! Let the electric motor take some effort off from those long commutes.  <br><br><br>

<h1>Women's Bikes</h1> <br>

Lower cross bar to keep your modesty when you're riding a bike in a skirt!  <br><br><br>

<h1>Children's Bikes</h1> <br>

Ever tried to go on a family bike ride and realized your toddlers can't keep up with your glorious 700c wheels with their short legs? Get your children a bike! <br><br><br>
