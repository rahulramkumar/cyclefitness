Thanks to everyone who came out for our Holiday themed December bike ride! It was a cold morning but you guys all perservered. There were at least 5 Santas riding with us and I'd like to thank them for helping us get a tradition going. We hope to see you all next month for the second monthly bike ride of hopefully many more to come!
